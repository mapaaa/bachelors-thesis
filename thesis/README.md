## Building instructions and requirements
The thesis is written in [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and built with [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
with the help of [UseLATEX](https://gitlab.kitware.com/kmorel/UseLATEX).
Check that you have these installed. Then make a new folder inside this one and run cmake. Example:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
```
